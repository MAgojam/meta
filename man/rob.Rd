\description{
Create table with risk of bias assessment or add table to existing
meta-analysis
}
\details{
This function can be used to define a risk of bias (RoB) assessment
for a meta-analysis which can be shown in a forest plot
(\code{\link{forest.meta}}), summary weighted barplot
(\code{\link{barplot.rob}}) or traffic light plot
(\code{\link{traffic_light}}). It is also possible to extract the
risk of bias assessment from a meta-analysis with RoB information.

The risk of bias table contains

\itemize{
\item study labels;
\item variables for individual RoB domains (with variable names A,
  B, \dots);
\item an overall RoB assessment if argument \code{overall} is
  provided;
\item weights for individual studies used in summary weighted
  barplots.
}
Note, an overall RoB assessment is mandatory to create a summary
weighted barplot or a traffic light plot.

The RoB table is directly returned if argument \code{data} is a
data frame or argument \code{item1} is a meta-analysis with risk of
bias assessment. The RoB table is added as a new list element 'rob'
to a meta-analysis object if argument \code{data} is a
meta-analysis.

The user must either specify the categories and (optionally)
domains of the RoB tool (using the eponymous arguments) or one of
the following RoB tools.

\subsection{Risk of bias domains}{

By default, i.e., if argument \code{domains} is not provided by the
user, the following names are used for RoB domains.

\itemize{
\item RoB 1 tool for randomized studies (RoB1):

\enumerate{
 \item Random sequence generation (selection bias)
 \item Allocation concealment (selection bias)
 \item Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
 \item Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
 \item Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
 \item Selective reporting (reporting bias)
 \item Other bias
}

\item RoB 2 tool for randomized studies (RoB2):
\enumerate{
 \item Bias arising from the randomization process
 \item Bias due to deviations from intended intervention"
 \item Bias due to missing outcome data
 \item Bias in measurement of the outcome
 \item Bias in selection of the reported result
}

\item RoB 2 tool for cluster-randomized trials (RoB2-cluster):
\enumerate{
 \item Bias arising from the randomization process
 \item Bias arising from the identification or recruitment of
   participants into clusters
 \item Bias due to deviations from intended intervention
 \item Bias due to missing outcome data
 \item Bias in measurement of the outcome
 \item Bias in selection of the reported result
}

\item RoB 2 tool for crossover trials (RoB2-crossover)
\enumerate{
 \item Bias arising from the randomization process
 \item Bias arising from period and carryover effects
 \item Bias due to deviations from intended intervention
 \item Bias due to missing outcome data
 \item Bias in measurement of the outcome
 \item Bias in selection of the reported result
}

\item Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Intervention (ROBINS-I):
\enumerate{
 \item Risk of bias due to confounding
 \item Risk of bias in selection of participants into the study
 \item Risk of bias in classification of interventions
 \item Risk of bias due to deviations from intented interventions
 \item Risk of bias due to missing outcome data
 \item Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome
 \item Risk of bias in the selection of the reported results
}

\item Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Exposures (ROBINS-E):
\enumerate{
 \item Risk of bias due to confounding
 \item Risk of bias arising from measurement of the exposure into
   the study (or into the analysis)
 \item Risk of bias due to post-exposure interventions
 \item Risk of bias due to deviations from intented interventions
 \item Risk of bias due to missing outcome data
 \item Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome
 \item Risk of bias in the selection of the reported results
}

\item User-defined RoB assessment:
\enumerate{
 \item First item
 \item Second item
 \item \dots
}
}

It is possible to define additional bias domains for the available
RoB tools. In this case, only the names for new RoB domains have to
be provided in argument \code{domains}. If argument \code{domains}
is not used to specify new domains, the names "Additional item 1"
etc. will be used. It is also possible to modify the pre-defined
domain names using argument \code{domains}.

The maximum number of bias domains / items is ten (see arguments
\code{item1}, ..., \code{item10}).
}

\subsection{Risk of bias categories, colours and symbols}{

By default, the following settings are used.

RoB 1 tool:

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Values} \cr
\code{categories} \tab "Low risk of bias", "Unclear risk of bias",
  "High risk of bias" \cr
\code{col} \tab "green", "yellow", "red" \cr
\code{symbols} \tab "+", "?", "-"
}

RoB 2 tools:

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Values} \cr
\code{categories} \tab "Low risk of bias", "Some concerns",
  "High risk of bias" \cr
\code{col} \tab "green", "yellow", "red" \cr
\code{symbols} \tab "+", "?", "-"
}

ROBINS tools:

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Values} \cr
\code{categories} \tab "Low risk", "Some concerns", "High risk",
  "Very high risk", "NI" \cr
\code{col} \tab "green", "yellow", "red", "darkred", "darkgrey" \cr
\code{symbols} \tab none
}

User-defined RoB tools:

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Values} \cr
\code{categories} \tab Must be specified by the user \cr
\code{col} \tab 1, 2, ... \cr
\code{symbols} \tab none
}

If colours (\code{col}) and symbols (\code{symbols}) are provided,
they must be of the same length as the number of categories.
